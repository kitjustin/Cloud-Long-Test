        <h1>Cloud Computing</h1>
        <p>Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of computing services such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="function">
        <h2>Function of Cloud Computing</h2>
        <img src="OIP.jpg" alt="" id="image-left" >
        <ol id="olf">
            <li>Scalable Computing Infrastructure:</li>
                <p>Cloud computing provides access to a scalable pool of computing resources that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort. This allows businesses to easily scale their infrastructure up or down based on demand, without the need for physical hardware upgrades or maintenan</p>
            <li>Pay-Per-Use Model: </li>
                <p>With cloud computing, users typically pay only for the resources they consume on a pay-per-use basis. This cost-effective model allows organizations to avoid upfront capital expenses for hardware and infrastructure, instead paying for services on a subscription or usage basis.</p>  
            <li>Flexibility and Accessibility: </li>
                <p>Cloud computing offers flexibility by enabling users to access applications and data from any internet-connected device, regardless of their location. This accessibility promotes collaboration and productivity among remote teams and allows for seamless integration of distributed workflows.</p>
            <li>Reliability and Redundancy: </li>
                <p>Cloud providers often operate multiple data centers across different geographic regions, offering redundancy and reliability for critical services. This redundancy helps ensure high availability and fault tolerance, reducing the risk of downtime due to hardware failures or natural disasters.</p>
            <li>Elasticity and On-Demand Resources</li>
                <p> Cloud computing enables elasticity, allowing resources to automatically scale up or down in response to fluctuating workloads. This dynamic provisioning of resources ensures optimal performance and efficiency, without the need for manual intervention.</p>

    <div class="benefits">
        <h2>Benifits :</h2>
        <li>1. Cost Efficiency: Cloud computing eliminates the need for upfront investments in hardware and infrastructure, as well as the ongoing costs associated with maintenance, upgrades, and physical space.</li>
        <l1>2. Scalability: Cloud computing provides on-demand access to a scalable pool of resources, allowing users to easily scale up or down based on demand.</l1>
        <li>3. Flexibility and Accessibility: Cloud services can be accessed from any internet-connected device, enabling users to work remotely and collaborate in real-time.</li>
        <li>4. Reliability and Redundancy: Cloud providers operate multiple data centers across different geographic regions, offering redundancy and high availability for critical services.</li>
        <li>5. Security and Compliance: Cloud providers invest heavily in security measures to protect data and infrastructure from cyber threats. They employ advanced encryption, authentication, and access control mechanisms to safeguard sensitive information.</li>
